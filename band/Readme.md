# Conveyor Belt System Assembly Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines the assembly process for a conveyor belt system, including the procurement of necessary materials, the 3D printing of components, and the final assembly. Designed for efficiency and precision, the system incorporates a USB camera for monitoring and is powered by a step motor for smooth operation.

## Materials Required

The following materials are needed to construct the skeleton of the conveyor belt system:

- **Conveyor Belt**: 1 unit
- **3D Printed Rollers**: 2 units
- **Shafts (17x1 cm)**: 2 units
- **Gears**: 2 units
- **Belt**: 1 unit
- **Chipboards (70x10 cm)**: 2 units
- **Chipboards (70x15 cm)**: 2 units
- **Tripod**: 1 unit

## Assembly Steps

1. **3D Printing of Rollers**: Begin by 3D printing the rollers designed to rotate the conveyor belt.
   
2. **Skeleton Construction**:
   - Cut the chipboards to the specified dimensions to fit the conveyor belt and rollers.
   - Assemble these parts to form the system's skeleton.

3. **Distance Sensor Installation**:
   - Integrate the necessary components for the distance sensor into the system, as depicted in Figure-1.

4. **Camera Setup**:
   - Use a tripod to position the USB camera above the conveyor system.
   - Adjust the camera angle to ensure optimal coverage of the conveyor belt.

5. **Step Motor Installation**:
   - Adjust the step motor belt tension.
   - Secure the step motor to the system, completing the assembly process.

## Conclusion

Following these steps, you will have successfully assembled the conveyor belt system. This guide aims to facilitate a smooth assembly process, ensuring that all components are correctly integrated for the system's optimal performance.
