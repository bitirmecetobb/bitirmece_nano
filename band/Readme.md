# Conveyor Belt System Project Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to assembling and programming a conveyor belt system. The project involves constructing the system's physical structure, integrating electronic components, and implementing control software. The system is designed to halt the conveyor belt when an object reaches a specified location, detected by a distance sensor. A USB camera is mounted for monitoring purposes, and a step motor controls the belt's movement.

## Materials and Components

### Mechanical Construction

- **Conveyor Belt**: 1 unit
- **3D Printed Rollers**: 2 units
- **Shafts (17x1 cm)**: 2 units
- **Gears**: 2 units
- **Belts**: 2 units
- **Chipboards**: 2 units (70x10 cm), 2 units (70x15 cm)
- **Tripod**: 1 unit for USB camera mounting

### Electronic Components and Controllers

- **TB6600 Microstep Driver**: For step motor control
- **HC-SR04 Distance Sensor**: For detecting the object's position on the conveyor belt
- **Arduino Uno**: To interface with the TB6600 and HC-SR04, and to mitigate potential damage to the Jetson Nano
- **Jetson Nano**: For additional processing and control tasks (not directly interfaced in the initial setup)

## Assembly Instructions

1. **Skeleton Assembly**:
   - Print the rollers using a 3D printer.
   - Cut the chipboards to size and assemble them along with the conveyor belt, rollers, shafts, and gears to form the system's framework.

2. **Electronics Integration**:
   - Mount the USB camera on the tripod and adjust its angle for optimal view of the conveyor belt.
   - Adjust the step motor belt tension and secure it to the system.

3. **Sensor and Driver Installation**:
   - Install the TB6600 Microstep Driver and connect it to the step motor.
   - Mount the HC-SR04 distance sensor in a position to effectively detect objects on the conveyor belt.

4. **Wiring and Connections**:
   - Connect the TB6600 and HC-SR04 to the Arduino Uno, ensuring proper wiring for power, signal, and control lines.

## Programming

The system is controlled through an Arduino Uno, programmed via the Arduino IDE. The code controls the step motor through the TB6600 driver and reads the HC-SR04 distance sensor to determine when to stop the conveyor belt.

Ensure to replace the placeholder with actual code that initializes the TB6600 and HC-SR04, and includes logic for controlling the motor based on sensor inputs.

## System Integration

- After programming the Arduino Uno, establish communication between the Arduino and the Jetson Nano if necessary. This setup allows for more complex processing or integration with other systems.
- Finalize the assembly by ensuring all components are securely mounted and wired correctly.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the complete process of building and programming a conveyor belt system, from the mechanical assembly through to the electronic integration and software control. By following these instructions, you will have a functional conveyor belt system capable of detecting objects and controlling the belt movement accordingly.
